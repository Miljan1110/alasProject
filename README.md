## Getting started

Hello, my name is Miljan Biocanin. This is the project I worked on after applying for a job at Alas doo Novi Sad.

There are three tasks in the Manual tasks folder:

- 2. PART  - test cases for testing a walmart.com page

- 3. PART - testing of ffl123.com website, with the focus on improving the user experience


## Automation Project tasks

Automation Project is a Maven project named Automation.
The task was to use explicitly Junit5, and FirefocDriver.
In the .pom file, I have included the depencies needed.

Using a Page Object Model, I have saved the Xpaths, the methods, and the WebElement getters in Automation\src\main\java\pages

The tests are located in Automation\src\test\java\testPackage\Test.java


I have managed to successfully respond to the most of the requests in the Automation Project.
